## User Story
```
As a manager
I want to generate a webpage that displays my team's basic info
so that I have quick access to emails and GitHub profiles
```

## Description
I started with employee js file and created the appropriate classes for all employees. Then went to my app.js file to connect all employees and created an appropriate prompt array. Once the answers were filled in, I took those answers into creating the new cards for the employees.
